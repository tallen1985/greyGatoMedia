    <h3>What's with the name?</h3>
    <p>
        In 2018, a whole bunch of things came into my life that happened to be
        cool... and grey. My wife and I bought a house in the quaint little town
        of Newmarket NH, and it is a weathered grey cedar shake house.<br /><br />
        Shortly before that we got a small cat and he developed the nickname
        'Don Gato', he was also grey.<br /><br />When we moved into our house,
        there is a semi-finished garage (Its pictured above) and I wanted to
        turn it into a pseudo pub/hangout room. Searching for a cool old-school
        british-ey name... The Grey Gato was born.<br />
        <strong>Grey Gato Media is a Full-Stack web development enclave nestled in an
            old house on an old street in an old town. Run by an
            almost-middle-aged man.</strong>
